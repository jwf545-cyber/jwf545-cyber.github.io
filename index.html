        <h2>Production Diary – Week 15</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 13 February 2026</p>
        <p>
        This week I created my GitHub Pages portfolio website for the first time.
        I set up the main structure and added basic sections such as About,
        Projects, Skills and Contact.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am most happy with successfully publishing my website online.
        </p>
        <p>
        I found it difficult to understand how GitHub repositories connect to
        GitHub Pages at first.
        </p>
        <p>
        Next week, I want to improve the layout and add one small maths tool
        to demonstrate my programming skills.
