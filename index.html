        <h2>Production Diary – Week 15</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 13 February 2026</p>
        <p>
        This week, I set up my GitHub Pages portfolio website and created the main structure, including the About, Projects, Skills and Contact sections. I also learned how to connect my repository to GitHub Pages and make the website publicly available online.

        I am most proud of successfully publishing my website for the first time. At the beginning, I was confused about the difference between a user site and a project site, and I received a 404 error. After checking the repository name and adjusting the settings, I finally managed to make the correct URL work. This experience helped me understand how web hosting works in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
        The most challenging part was understanding how repository names affect the website address. However, solving this problem increased my confidence in using GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
       Through this task, I improved my understanding of HTML structure, basic website layout, and how files are deployed to the internet. Next week, I plan to improve the visual design of my portfolio and add a small computer science maths tool, such as a binary converter, to demonstrate my programming skills.
